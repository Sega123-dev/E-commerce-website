This is a clothing store website inspired by many clothing brands.It is simple and made to be beginner-friendly.It is made for learning purposes so i can be a better web developer.I combined almost all my knowledge of coding into one project.If you like this repo,consider giving a star.This repository is also made so i can learn and experiment more about Git and its advantages.

# Important note

node_modules and .env files are not pushed to GitHub because i was learning gitignore and wanted to implement that into my project.

# Design

I did not focus too much into the designing since i wanted to focus more on the backend part and to implement more functionalities through JavaScript.
